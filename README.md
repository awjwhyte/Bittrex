First of all, you will have to make sure you have node js installed. 

After you have cloned the project into a directory, you will ensure the necessary dependacies are installed. To do this, follow the following steps.

1. Navigate to the project location from the command line
2. Run npm install

After you have done this, proceed to create a new file in the root of the project and save it as .env.
include the following in the .env file

API_KEY=**********inset your api key here*********************  
API_SECRET=************insert your api secret here************  
URL=https://api.bittrex.com/api/v1.1/

You can then start runnimg commands to your account by navigating to the index.js file. 

You will see some highlighte examples that have been commented out. Activate them by deleting the double slashes before the commands. 

An example is client.private('getbalances')

After you have entered this command in the index.js file and saved it, navigate back to your commnd line and run node index.js. Running this command will run the code in the index.js file and produce the desired output.
